## Context

Most people use centralized social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and others. However, these networks often encounter problems related to the fact that they can block a user or delete their content if they violate the network's rules or standards. This, of course, ensures the safety of users by removing inappropriate or harmful content, but it can also be used against someone intentionally or accidentally.

One example of decentralized social networks is the **ActivityPub** protocol. This protocol allows anyone to create their own social network with their own rules and standards. However, at the moment, user data is still stored on servers belonging to a central authority. That is, before creating an account, the user must choose a server on which their data will be stored. Each of these servers has an owner who has full access to the data of users who have chosen their server.

The **Durudex Social** protocol aims to achieve complete decentralization, allowing everyone to create their own social network with their own rules, standards, and moderation. This ensures the complete safety of users, as their data is stored in a distributed network, and only the owners have access to edit or delete the data.

## Network

**Durudex Social** is a protocol for decentralized social networks. Each network built on this protocol is an independent part that is controlled by either a specific group of users or a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). Each network has its own rules, standards, moderation (content control), recommendations, and verification (user identity confirmation) that are determined by the network's leadership.

It is worth noting that dynamic user data that is not specific to a particular network is stored in a decentralized database that is shared by all networks built on the protocol. This approach allows for achieving:

* Using a single application for all networks simplifies the process of managing data and publishing content. Instead of using separate applications for each network, you can conveniently manage all your data and content in one place.
* Using a single account for all networks. Instead of having separate accounts for each network, you can conveniently manage all your data and content from one place.
* Using shared content between all networks allows you to publish content that will be available to all users regardless of the network. This simplifies the content publishing process, promotes efficiency, and allows you to reach a wider audience, as your content will be available for recommendations on any network.
