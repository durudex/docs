## Context

Most people use centralized social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and others. However, these networks often encounter problems related to the fact that they can block a user or delete their content if they violate the network's rules or standards. This, of course, ensures the safety of users by removing inappropriate or harmful content, but it can also be used against someone intentionally or accidentally.

One example of decentralized social networks is the **ActivityPub** protocol. This protocol allows anyone to create their own social network with their own rules and standards. However, at the moment, user data is still stored on servers belonging to a central authority. That is, before creating an account, the user must choose a server on which their data will be stored. Each of these servers has an owner who has full access to the data of users who have chosen their server.

The **Durudex Social** protocol aims to achieve complete decentralization, allowing everyone to create their own social network with their own rules, standards, and moderation. This ensures the complete safety of users, as their data is stored in a distributed network, and only the owners have access to edit or delete the data.
