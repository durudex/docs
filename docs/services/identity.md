# ğŸ‘¤ Identity

## Account

An account is the basis of a user's identity, which contains a unique identifier that distinguishes users. In addition to the identifier, an account may contain data such as name, avatar link, unique username, and other useful meta information.

## Sessions

In order to avoid requiring multiple users to use the same private key to access an account, we have implemented sessions that allow multiple users to manage the account.

> A session is a record in a database that is associated with a user's account and has certain data access level settings.
