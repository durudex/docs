  environment.

# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

## User choice

We invite every user to contribute to the project. The source code of the project is open for reading and modification, so users can make their own changes. Furthermore, users can create polls to decide on important issues. This way, everyone can have their say and help shape the project.

## Decentralization

The network is fully decentralized and can operate independently, without the need for a centralized authority. This means that users have greater control over their data and the platform is more secure and resistant to censorship. Additionally, it allows for faster transactions and more efficient decision-making, as decisions are made by consensus rather than by a single entity.

## Roadmap

The Durudex team is working hard to create a fully decentralized, user-driven social network as soon as possible. We have an ambitious roadmap to ensure that the network is fully ready for release.
