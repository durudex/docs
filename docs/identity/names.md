# üè∑ Names

## Account

Durudex names can be linked to a Durudex account, making it easier and quicker for other users to find a particular account. This is especially useful if you want to send someone cryptocurrency without knowing their address, as all you need to do is enter the username and the wallet will automatically find the address.
